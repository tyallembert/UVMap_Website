### A showcasing of the best new mobile app in town
This website is meant to showcase the ins-and-outs of our beautiful iOS Mobile App, UVMap. UVMap is an app, much like Google Maps or Apple Maps, which
helps visualize your travels and help you get to your destination. The next big thing has come to the University of Vermont, assisting the students of tomorrow.
